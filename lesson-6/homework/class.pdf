2. How do you add a slicer to a report?
In Power BI Desktop, select the Slicer visual from the Visualizations pane, then drag a field (e.g., Quarter) to it.

3. What is the difference between a bar chart and a column chart?
Bar Chart: Displays data with horizontal bars.

Column Chart: Displays data with vertical bars.

Both show comparisons, but orientation differs.

4. How do you change the color of a visual background?
Select the visual, go to the Format pane, find Background, and set the color.

5. What does "drill-down" mean in a visual?
Drill-down lets users click on a visual (e.g., bar) to see more detailed levels of data (e.g., from Region → Product → Quarter).

6. Create a bar chart showing SalesAmount by Region.
In Power BI:

Select the Bar Chart visual.

Drag Region to Axis and SalesAmount to Values.

7. Add a slicer for Quarter to filter all visuals on the page.
Add a Slicer visual.

Drag the Quarter field to the slicer.

All visuals will filter when you select a quarter.

Select the Line Chart visual.

Drag Quarter to Axis, SalesAmount to Values.

10. Add a tooltip to display Product details when hovering over bars.

When hovering, Product info appears.

11. Sync slicers across multiple report pages.
Select a slicer, go to View → Sync slicers pane.

Check pages where the slicer should be synced.

12. Create a custom visual with dynamic measure selection (e.g., Sales vs. Profit).

Create a DAX measure that switches based on the selection, and use it in your visual.

13. Implement a hierarchy for Region > Product > Quarter drill-down.
In the Fields pane, drag Product under Region, and Quarter under Product to create a hierarchy.

Use this hierarchy in your chart and enable drill-down (the forked arrow icon).

14. Use bookmarks to toggle between two visuals in the same space.

Go to View → Bookmarks, add a bookmark for each visual’s state.

Add Buttons to toggle bookmarks for switching visuals.

Reduce the number of visuals per page.

Avoid unnecessary complex calculations.

Use aggregation tables and disable auto date/time for new fields.

Only load needed columns and data.
